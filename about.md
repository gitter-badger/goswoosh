Founded by a team of Squaw/Truckee/Tahoe City locals who have spent a lifetime skiing Squaw. As active parents, we know how fun it is to ski the mountain with our kids and yet we are truly unhappy about sitting in traffic and taking up half our day on the asphalt instead of doing what we want to do.

We all chose to abandon the rat race of Silicon Valley and San Francisco to be closer to our mountains. And now we have chosen to apply our talents to making skiing squaw easier and hassle-free.

Enter stage left - Swoosh.  Swoosh is a high-trust, easy-to-schedule ride service for mountain sports families. Our initial focus is to provide personalized, scheduled and on-demand ride transport for families on the tahoe/truckee ski teams.  We expect to reduce traffic and environmental impact and help active families with busy schedules.
